Privacy Policy — Samektra Compliance Lens

Effective date: January 7, 2026

Samektra Compliance Lens (“the App”) is a compliance support tool intended for inspectors and safety/compliance professionals. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it’s used, and your choices.

1) Information the App may collect

Depending on how you use the App, it may handle:

User-provided content: notes you type, inspection details you enter, and files you choose to upload (such as photos, PDFs, or documents).

Device permissions (optional): If you enable them, the App may access your device camera or file picker so you can capture or select inspection media.

Basic technical data: limited technical information (like browser type or device characteristics) may be processed for basic functionality and troubleshooting.

2) How information is used

Information is used to:

Provide the App’s features (creating, viewing, and organizing inspection-related content)

Improve reliability and performance

Troubleshoot issues and support users

3) Data storage

The App may store certain information locally on your device (for example in browser storage) so you can use features like history or saved entries.

If the App includes any cloud features, data may be stored on servers you interact with.

4) Third-party processing (only keep if true)

If the App offers AI-assisted analysis or external processing, content you submit (such as text, images, or documents) may be sent to third-party service providers solely to perform the requested function. These providers may process data according to their own terms and privacy policies.

We recommend not uploading sensitive information (e.g., patient data, Social Security numbers, payment card information, or confidential regulated data).

5) Sharing of information

We do not sell your personal information. Information may be shared only:

With service providers needed to operate the App (hosting, processing, analytics—if used)

If required by law or to protect rights/safety

6) Your choices

You can choose what information to input or upload.

You can remove locally stored data by clearing the App’s storage in your browser/app settings (or using any in-app “reset history” feature, if available).

7) Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 and is intended for professional use.
